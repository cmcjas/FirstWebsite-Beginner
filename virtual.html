                        Nanite's virtualized micropolygon geometry system enables developers to create games with massive amounts of geometric detail.
                        You can directly import film-quality source art composed of millions of polygons; anything from ZBrush sculpts to photogrammetry scans, and place them millions of times,
                        all while maintaining a real-time framerate, and without any noticeable loss of fidelity. Nanite intelligently streams and processes only the detail you can perceive,
                        largely removing triangle count and draw call constraints. It eliminates time-consuming work, such as baking details to normal maps and manually authoring levels of detail,
                        freeing you to concentrate on creativity.

                        Lumen is a fully dynamic global illumination and reflections solution that immediately reacts to scene and light changes, offering artists and designers the ability to create more dynamic scenes with greater realism.
                        Changing the angle of the sun, turning on a flashlight, opening an exterior door, or even blowing up a wall will cause a change to indirect lighting and reflections. The system renders diffuse interreflection with
                        infinite bounces and indirect specular reflections, highlighting even the most minute details within expansive, elaborate environments. Artists and designers are no longer tied to static scenes with precomputed
                        lighting baked into textures—a huge time saving when you can see the results of changes right in the editor without needing to rebuild lighting, or to set up lightmap UVs for individual Static Meshes.

                        MetaHuman is a complete framework that gives any creator the power to use highly realistic human characters in any way imaginable. It includes MetaHuman Creator, a free cloud-based app that enables you to create fully
                        rigged photorealistic digital humans in minutes. MetaHumans can run in real time on high-end PCs with RTX graphics cards, even at their highest quality with strand-based hair and ray tracing enabled. Assets come with
                        eight LODs, some of which employ hair cards, enabling you to achieve real-time performance on everything from Android to XSX and PS5.

                        Unreal Engine enables game developers and creators across industries to realize next-generation real-time 3D content and experiences with greater freedom, fidelity, and flexibility than ever before. In Unreal Engine 5,
                        we’ve significantly extended and improved our modeling toolset, including mesh editing, UV creation and editing, and baking and mesh attributes. With these tools, artists can develop and iterate on assets directly
                        within the Unreal Editor, saving time and reducing the potential for errors. In addition, it makes it faster and easier to work with dense meshes, such as those generated using photogrammetry tools or by kitbashing.

                <h4>Unreal Engine's latest in-camera VFX toolset gets a test drive'</h4>
                <p>
                    Recently, Epic Games and Bullitt assembled a team to test out the latest virtual production features coming in Unreal Engine 4.27. The three-minute production test they created was
                    shot on an LED stage over just four days.

                    In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing more information about these tools and releasing the project as a sample. Sign up to get updates.
